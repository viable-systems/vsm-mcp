# VSM-MCP Fallback Simulation Removal Summary

## Overview
All fallback simulation code has been removed from the VSM-MCP System1 module to ensure the system uses real MCP servers or fails with proper error messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Simulation Fallbacks in Core Operations

#### `process_operation/2`
- **Before**: Would fall back to simulated response if LLM failed
- **After**: Returns error: `"Cannot process operation without MCP server: #{reason}"`

#### `transform_operation/2`
- **Before**: Would fall back to simulated transformation if LLM failed
- **After**: Returns error: `"Cannot transform data without MCP server: #{reason}"`

### 2. Removed Direct Execution Bypass

#### `acquire_mcp_capability/2`
- **Before**: Would fall back to `execute_capability_directly/1` if MCP server integration failed
- **After**: Returns error: `"Failed to acquire capability via MCP server: #{reason}"`

### 3. Removed All Direct Capability Functions
Completely removed the following functions that bypassed MCP:
- `execute_capability_directly/1`
- `create_real_document/1`
- `create_real_image/1`
- `perform_real_analysis/1`
- `perform_real_scraping/1`
- `create_pdf_from_markdown/2`
- `convert_svg_to_png/2`
- `calculate_std_dev/1`
- `percentile/2`
- `analyze_distribution/1`

### 4. Removed Alternative Capability Execution
Removed all functions that provided alternative ways to execute capabilities without MCP:
- `send_mcp_request/3`
- `execute_capability_with_guidance/2`
- `create_presentation_capability/0`
- `create_document_capability/1`
- `create_visualization_capability/1`
- `execute_computation_capability/1`
- `execute_data_fetch_capability/1`
- `execute_generic_capability/1`
- `execute_generated_capability/2`
- `try_alternative_capability_approaches/1`

### 5. Updated Unknown Method Handling

#### `acquire_capability/2`
- **Before**: Would return success for unknown methods
- **After**: Returns error: `"Unknown capability acquisition method: #{method}. MCP server required."`

## Result
The system now has a clear requirement: it MUST use real MCP servers for capability acquisition or return appropriate error messages. There are no simulation fallbacks, mock responses, or direct execution bypasses.

## Testing
Created `test_no_fallback.exs` to verify that the system properly requires MCP servers and returns errors when they're not available.

## Verification
- Searched for all simulation-related keywords: ✓ Removed
- Searched for direct execution functions: ✓ Removed
- Searched for fallback patterns: ✓ Removed
- Checked other modules for similar code: ✓ Clean

The VSM-MCP system is now forced to use real MCP integration or fail explicitly.
