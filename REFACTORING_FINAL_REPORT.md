## Critical Issue Analysis

### 🚨 Compilation Error Details
```elixir
error: AsyncResponse.__struct__/1 is undefined, cannot expand struct AsyncResponse. 
Make sure the struct name is correct.
File: lib/vsm_mcp/llm/api.ex:196:13
Line: {:ok, %AsyncResponse{id: ref}} ->
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Struct Definition**: `AsyncResponse` struct not defined in codebase
2. **Import Issue**: Struct may be defined but not properly imported
3. **Module Dependency**: Required module may not be available

### Impact Assessment
- **Development**: Cannot compile project
- **Testing**: All tests blocked by compilation failure
- **Deployment**: Production deployment impossible
- **Integration**: MCP LLM integration non-functional
