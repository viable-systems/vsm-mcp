| Package Whitelist | ✅ PASS | 4/4 | All unauthorized packages blocked |
| Injection Protection | ✅ PASS | 7/7 | Command sanitization working |
| Audit Logging | ✅ PASS | 4/4 | All security events logged |
| Sandbox Isolation | ❌ FAIL | 0/6 | Needs improvement |

**Critical Finding:** Sandbox isolation requires enhancement to block dangerous commands effectively.

**Security Events Logged:**
```
- Command blocked: "rm -rf /"
- Package denied: "malicious-package"  
- Injection detected: "; cat /etc/passwd"
- Sandbox violation: "file system access denied"
```

### 3. Error Handling and Resilience ⚡ 75% PASS

**Overall Score:** 3/4 test categories passed

#### Error Handling Test Results:
