### 6. Compilation Status ‚ùå UNANIMOUS BLOCK

#### Decision: **BLOCKED** (6/6 votes)

**All Agents Unanimous Decision**:
> "CRITICAL COMPILATION ERROR blocks all deployment scenarios. AsyncResponse struct undefined in `lib/vsm_mcp/llm/api.ex:196` prevents system compilation. No production deployment possible until resolved. **UNANIMOUSLY BLOCKED.**"

**Blocking Issue Details**:
```elixir
error: AsyncResponse.__struct__/1 is undefined, cannot expand struct AsyncResponse.
File: lib/vsm_mcp/llm/api.ex:196:13
Line: {:ok, %AsyncResponse{id: ref}} ->
```

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚ùå Cannot compile project (`mix compile` fails)
- ‚ùå Cannot run tests (`mix test` blocked)
- ‚ùå Cannot create production release
- ‚ùå Cannot deploy to any environment
- ‚ùå MCP LLM integration non-functional

**Unanimous Consensus**: DEPLOYMENT ABSOLUTELY BLOCKED until compilation error resolved.
