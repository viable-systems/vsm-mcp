echo "1. System detected variety gap (blockchain capability needed)"
echo "2. Searched NPM registry for 'blockchain mcp server'"

echo "============================================"
echo "- generateVanityAddress: Generate Ethereum addresses with prefix"
echo "- cast_balance: Check ETH balance"
echo "- cast_send: Send transactions"
echo "- cast_call: Call smart contracts"
